# Voxel-to-Mesh
This is a general repository to create various mesh and obj files from simple text files

The code is designed to be simple to read and modify with few required libraries to ease compiling.
The motivation was derived from the difficulty 

Since the code was designed to be used for homogenization purposes the tetrahedrons are similar on all faces to align to neighboring voxels and the extreme outer faces for periodic super voxels.
